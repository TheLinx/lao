  <h1 class="cb">api overview</h1>
  <p>lao is designed to stick to libao principles, but also makes sure
  you're still programming Lua. The API is very similar to libao's, but
  it has been simplified so you wont have to deal with creating a special
  type of userdata for sample formats, options, et.c.</p>
  <p>To use lao, follow these steps:</p>
  <ul class="notmenu">
    <li>
      Include lao in your program by calling <tt>require("ao")</tt>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Unlike libao, <a class="tt" href="ao_initialize.html">ao.initalize</a>
      is called when lao is <tt>require</tt>d. However, you can still call
      it to restart the libao environment after you've called
      <a class="tt" href="ao_shutdown.html">ao.shutdown</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Call <a class="tt" href="ao_default_driver_id.html">ao.defaultDriverId</a>
      to get the ID number of the default output driver. If you want to
      specify a particular output driver, you may call
      <a class="tt" href="ao_driver_id.html">ao.driverId</a> with a string
      corresponding to the short name of the device (i.e. "oss", "wav",
      et.c.) instead.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are using the default device, no extra options are needed.
      However, if you wish to pass special options to the device, you will
      need to supply an option table to the ao.Open**** function.
    </li>
    <li>
      Call <a class="tt" href="ao_open_live.html">ao.openLive()</a> and
      save the return value (!). That will be the device you use to play
      and without it, well, you can't play stuff. If you are using a file
      output driver, you will need to call
      <a class="tt" href="ao_open_file.html">ao.openFile()</a> instead.
    </li>
    <li>
      Call <a class="tt" href="device_play.html">device:play()</a> on
      each block of audio.
    </li>
    <li>
      The following steps are optional since it's handled by lao's __gc
      handlers, but you may want to do this manually for different reasons.
    </li>
    <li>
      Call <a class="tt" href="device_close.html">device:close()</a> to
      close the device.
    </li>
    <li>
      Call <a class="tt" href="ao_shutdown.html">ao.shutdown()</a> to
      shutdown the libao environment.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <span class="r">Warning:</span> currently, if you try to close a
    device after the libao environment has been shut down, lao will segfault.
